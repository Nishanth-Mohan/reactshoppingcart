         - Displays the navigation bar with links to different sections of the website.
         - Includes a shopping cart icon with the total number of items in the cart.
         - Receives the value state as a prop to display the number of items in the cart.
     **Card Component (Card.js):**
  
          - Renders product cards dynamically based on the data passed as props.
          - Each card displays an image, item details, price, and an "Add to cart" or "Remove from cart" button based on the status.
          - Manages the state for the status of each card (whether it's in the cart or not) using the useState hook.

     **Footer Component (Footer.js):**
  
          - Displays the footer section of the website.

**Styling:**
    The application uses Bootstrap for styling to ensure responsiveness and a clean UI.
    Cards are laid out in a grid format using Bootstrap grid classes.
    The navigation bar and buttons are styled using Bootstrap's predefined classes.
